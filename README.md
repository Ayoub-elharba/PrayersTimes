# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Key Features:

User-Friendly Interface: The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to effortlessly navigate and access prayer time information.

Location-Based Prayer Times: Utilizing Geolocation API, the app detects the user's location automatically. Users also have the option to manually input their location for accurate prayer time calculations.

Real-Time Updates: The app dynamically updates prayer times based on the current date and user's location, ensuring accurate prayer schedules throughout the year.

Lightweight and Fast: Developed with Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for React applications, the project ensures quick loading times and smooth performance.

By combining the power of ReactJS, Vite, and Geolocation API, the Prayer Time Tracker offers a practical solution for individuals seeking an easy and reliable way to manage their daily prayers.
